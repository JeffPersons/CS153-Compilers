to build run: make java

Currently is just the refactored Pascal code, to have the Java names

TODO:
- Replace keywords in JavaToken from pascal to Java
- Modify JavaParserTD to have all necessary types in java, currently contains the pascal types: string, number, and real
- Modify JavaError to have error codes relevant to Java
- Modify all classes under tokens to be compliant with Java
- Modify Java.cpp to be correct under Java, for example change the token types in the ouput on line 203
- Modify FrontEndFactory (uncomment if the "pascal" string is passed it) to be able to provide both pascal and java frontends
- Change makefile to compile both Pascal and Java so that both programs can be called once compiled
- May have to modify JavaScanner - if modifying all tokens does not produce desired result
- May have to modify JavaErrorHandler if changing JavaError doe not produce desire result
- Hopefully no need to make changes to language independant classes - e.g. Parser.cpp
