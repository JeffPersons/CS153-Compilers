When starting, we assumed many of the components already provided would work accordingly. For example, we worried minimally about the source class because its structure proved relatively reliable. This caused in error in our code. When processing the javatest.in, the last line was skipped because of the way the source reads for the EOF. An additionally newline character is needed at the end of the file. One of the methods we added to the scanner was a peek_char method. This allowed us to scan for block comments, /**/, and process them in the skip white space section. The implementation was simple and effective.
