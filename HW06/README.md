# SimpL: The Simple Programming Language Â©
## Setup

#### Building SimpL Source
To build SimpL, navigate to the SimpL directory and run:

    ./build.sh

The above will generate antlr sources, compile all java into an `out` folder,
and run various tests. The project is built with the only dependencies being
the JVM assembler `Jasmin` and the parser generator `Antlr`.


#### Compiling a SimpL program
To compile a `.simpl` file, navigate to the SimpL directory and run:

    ./simplc.sh <source_filepath>

The above will generate .j (JVM assembly) and a .class (JVM bytecode) files of
the same name. The output location defaults to the parent directory of the given
sourcefile, but can be specified with the command line option `-d`
(to be added in the near future).


#### Executing a SimpL program
To execute a program, run it by specifying its compiled class filepath by using:

    ./simplr.sh <class_filepath>

The above will run the compiled SimpL program with any output printed to
console.


#### Troubleshooting and Tips

If executing `java` or `javac` directly, ensure classpath is set correctly by
using:
    
    export CLASSPATH="out:<jasmin2.4-jar-path>:<antlr4.7-jar-path>:$CLASSPATH"

If a `permission denied` error occurred while running a script, grant access by
using:

    chmod +x ./<script_filepath>.sh

If newline issues occur after modifying the scripts on windows, remove excess
new line characters by using:

    sed -i 's/\r$//' ./<script_filepath>

Delete any generated jasmin and class files by using:

    find <output_directorypath> -maxdepth 1 -regex ".*\.\(j\|class\)" -type f -delete


## Syntax
#### Overview
Only single programs are supported, of which consistent of multiple statements,
each of which are terminated with a line break.

Statements include function definition, declaration, assignment,
standalone expression, conditional, and while loop.

Blocks consist of a `{` <0 or more statements> `}`, with the braces on their own
lines. Blocks are expected following conditionals, function signatures, and
loops. Again, curly braces MUST be on their own separate lines - this means
egyptian/K & R style braces are NOT supported, sorry!

Expressions are any mix of enclosed parentheses, literals, identifiers,
function calls, and operations.

Datatypes currently include `Number` and `Text`.
The more elaborate constructs `Map`, `List`, `Struct`, `Func` are planned for
the future.


#### Operators
Support for parenthetical, arithmetic, boolean, comparison operations
```
-------- Operator Precedence (HI to LO) --------
| order |  operator  |         meaning         |
|   0   |     ()     |       parenthesis       |
|   1   |     ^      |      exponentiation     |
|   2   |    * /     |   multiply and divide   |
|   3   |    + -     |     add and subtract    |
|   4   | < > <= >=  |       comparison        |
|   5   |   == !=    |        equality         |
|   6   |    not     |    logical negation     |
|   7   |    and     |   logical conjunction   |
|   8   |    or      |   logical disjunction   |
------------------------------------------------
```


#### Conditionals
Syntax for conditionals is as follows:
```
if <expression>
{
    <0 or more statements>
}
elif <expression>
{
    <0 or more statements>
}
else
{
    <0 or more statements>
}
```
