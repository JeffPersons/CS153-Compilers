# SimpL Â©: Language Overview

## Motivation and Summary
SimpL is a _simple_ language for _simple_ people, who are tired of overbearing
syntax or are simply just learning to program.
Elements of SimpL's syntax were influenced by Python, with all statements
ending in a line break instead of the more traditional semicolon.

Unlike Python, however, SimpL is a statically typed, dynamically scoped
language that compiles and runs on the JVM. It was built using `Jasmin`
(JVM assembly) for intermediate code generation, and `ANTLR4` for parser
source code generation.

SimpL programs are single files ending with a `.simpl` extension, that when
compiled generates respective .j (Jasmin) and .class (bytecode) files.


## General Syntactic Elements
Only _single programs_ are supported, of which consistent of multiple
statements, each of which are terminated with a line break. Any curly
braces must be on their own separate lines -- no egyptian style braces, sorry!

#### Expressions
An `expression` is any mix of parenthetical expressions, datatype literals,
identifiers, function calls, and operations.

#### Statements
A `name` is an underscore or letter followed by any combination of
underscores, letters, or numbers. This applies to both function and
variable names.

A `statement` is a declaration, assignment, standalone expression,
function definition, conditional, and while loop. Of those, the last three
are multiline statements with the following syntax:
```
<keyword> <expression>
{
    <0 or more statements>
    <optional return statement>
}
```
Note that the above braces and their enclosed statements form a block.
Thus, blocks follow all function signatures, as well as all while, if,
else if, else conditions.

#### Comments
Any `comment` is ignored by the SimpL parser, along with tabs and excess
newlines.

Single line comments have the following syntax:
```
## <some single line comment>
```
Multiline comments have the following syntax:
```
##
<some multiline comment>
##
```


## Datatypes

#### Number
An integer or decimal number (internally stored as a _double_),
with the following syntax for literals:
```
<1 or more digits>
<1 or more digits>.<1 or more digits>
```

#### Text
A character sequence (internally stored as a _String_),
with the following syntax for literals:
 ```
'<0 more characters>'
```
Note that quotes and slashes can be escaped with a slash (eg \' \\).

#### Boolean
A true or false token (internally stored as a _boolean_),
with the following syntax for literals:
```
True
False
```


## Operators
Support for parenthetical, arithmetic, boolean, comparison operations,
ordered from high to low precedence:
```
---------------- Operator Precedence ---------------
| order |  operator  |           meaning           |
|   0   |     ()     |         parenthesis         |
|   1   |     ^      |        exponentiation       |
|   2   |    * /     |     multiply and divide     |
|   3   |    + -     |       add and subtract      |
|   4   | < > <= >=  |          comparison         |
|   5   |   == !=    |   equality and inequality   |
|   6   |    not     |       logical negation      |
|   7   |    and     |     logical conjunction     |
|   8   |    or      |     logical disjunction     |
|   8   |    =       |          assignment         |
----------------------------------------------------
```
Equality, parenthesis, and assignment operators apply to _any_ expression
and _any_ datatype.
Comparison and arithmetic operators apply only to `Numbers`.
Logical operators apply only to `Booleans`.


## Variables, Declarations, and Assignments
Support for variables is restricted to datatypes `Number` and `Text`.
Variables can declared with or without an initial value, as follows:
```
<datatype> <name> = <expression>
<datatype> <name>
```

#### Control Flow
Syntax for conditionals is as follows:
```
if <expression>
{
    <0 or more statements>
}
elif <expression>
{
    <0 or more statements>
}
else
{
    <0 or more statements>
}
```
Syntax for loops is as follows:
```
while <expression>
{
    <0 or more statements>
}
```


## Functions

#### Function Definitions
A `function` definition consisting of a signature and a body,
with the following syntax:
```
<void or datatype> <name>(<parameter list>)
{
    <0 or more statements>
}
```
If the return type is void, then nothing is returned within the function.
Above, `<parameter list>` is comma separated list of one more `<datatype> <name>`.

#### Function Calls
A `function` defined within the current scope is invoked,
with the following syntax:
```
<name>(<argument list>)
```
Above, `<argument list>` is defined a comma separated list of one or more `<name>`.
When calling functions, arguments are passed by value, and must correspond to
the parameters specified in the function definition.

#### Builtin Functions
Predefined functions `print` and `println` are available, and take any
number of arguments. Just like in Java, `print` writes the expression to
standard out, 


## Error Handling
Errors and exceptions encountered during compilation are written to standard
error.

#### Type Checking
Errors are raised to ensure operators are between appropriate type(s),
as specified in the _Operators_ section from before.

#### Error Recovery
Like most compilers, `SimpL` will continue parsing the rest of the file even if
an error occurs.
